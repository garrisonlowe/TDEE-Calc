## 🎯 Common Use Cases

### "I want to lose weight"
1. Use TDEE Calculator to get your TDEE
2. Choose a fat loss target (Moderate = 500 cal deficit = 1 lb/week)

## 👥 Multi-User Support

**Perfect for families or coaching!**

In the Daily Tracker tab:
1. Use the user selector dropdown at the top
2. Click **"➕ Add User"** to add family members
3. Each person gets:
   - Separate tracking data
   - Independent charts

## 📈 Using the Charts

All charts in Daily Tracker support **pan/scroll**:

1. **Weight Chart**: Track overall trend, ignore daily fluctuations
2. **Steps Chart**: Identify activity patterns
3. **Sleep Chart**: Correlate sleep with energy/performance
4. **Calories Chart**: See your intake consistency
5. **Energy Chart**: Find patterns (low energy after poor sleep?)

**Pro Tip**: Look for correlations between charts!

## 🔥 Power User Tips

**Weigh Daily** → Weekly averages smooth out water fluctuations  
**Track Everything** → Even "off" days matter for trends  
**Use Cloud Sync** → Data persists forever, accessible anywhere  
**Select Correct User** → Check user dropdown before entering data  
**Review Charts Weekly** → Patterns > individual days  
**Be Consistent** → Same time, same conditions (morning weigh-ins)  
**Trust the Process** → 2+ weeks of data = accurate TDEE

---

## 🚨 Red Flags to Watch

Monitor these patterns in your data:

- **Weight dropping >2 lbs/week** → Increase calories (muscle loss risk)
- **Energy consistently 1-2 ("Very Low" to "Low")** → Eat more or sleep more
- **Sleep <7 hrs regularly** → Fix this ASAP (affects metabolism & recovery)
- **Steps decreasing over time** → Sign of adaptive thermogenesis
- **Workouts suffering** → Reduce volume or increase calories

---

## ☁️ Cloud Storage & Data

**Automatic Backup**: Data saves to Google Sheets automatically  
**Access Anywhere**: Use the deployed app link on any device  
**Never Lose Data**: Cloud storage persists across browser sessions  
**Multi-Device**: Start on phone, continue on computer  

**Local Fallback**: If Google Sheets fails, app uses JSON files locally

## 🎯 Goal-Specific Tracking

### Fat Loss (Moderate - Recommended):
- **Target**: TDEE - 500 cal = ~1 lb/week
- **Track**: Weight trending down, energy stable (3-4), lifts maintained
- **Red Flag**: Energy below 3 consistently, strength dropping

### Aggressive Fat Loss:
- **Target**: TDEE - 750 cal = ~1.5 lbs/week  
- **Track**: Higher diet fatigue, may need diet breaks
- **Red Flag**: Energy below 2, strength tanking, sleep suffering

### Lean Bulk:
- **Target**: TDEE + 200 cal = ~0.5 lb/week
- **Track**: Weight up slowly, lifts progressing, waist stable
- **Red Flag**: Gaining >1 lb/week, waist growing too fast

### Standard Bulk:
- **Target**: TDEE + 350 cal = ~0.75 lb/week
- **Track**: Faster gains, accept slightly more fat
- **Red Flag**: Gaining >1.5 lbs/week

### Maintenance:
- **Target**: Hit TDEE ±100 cal
- **Track**: Weight stable (±2 lbs range), performance maintained
- **Red Flag**: Unintended weight change over 2+ weeks

## 📞 Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to create an account?**  
A: No! You can use the app as a guest. But creating an account saves your personal defaults.

**Q: What's the difference between My Profile and Daily Tracker users?**  
A: My Profile = your account settings. Daily Tracker users = tracking different people (like family members).

**Q: Do I need to track every day?**  
A: Yes! Consistency = success. Even incomplete data > no data. Trends matter most.

**Q: What if I mess up my diet?**  
A: LOG IT ANYWAY. "Bad" days are part of the trend. Never skip tracking.

**Q: My weight jumped 3 lbs overnight!**  
A: Totally normal. Water retention from sodium, carbs, or new exercise. Check weekly average.

**Q: I forgot to track for several days!**  
A: Fill in what you remember. Estimates > nothing. Get back on track today.

**Q: How do I add my dad/spouse to the app?**  
A: Daily Tracker tab → "Add New User" expander → Enter their name → Add User

**Q: Can I access this on my phone?**  
A: Yes! Use the deployed link on any device.

**Q: How accurate is the TDEE calculator?**  
A: Formula-only: ±10%. With 2+ weeks weight trend data: ±2-5% (lab-quality!)

## 🎓 Understanding Your Results

### What is TDEE?
**Total Daily Energy Expenditure** - the total calories you burn in a day, including:
- **BMR** (60-75%): Calories to keep you alive (heart beating, breathing, etc.)
- **TEF** (8-15%): Calories burned digesting food (higher with more protein!)
- **NEAT** (15-30%): Daily movement, fidgeting, walking around
- **EAT** (5-15%): Actual exercise (gym workouts, sports)
- **EPOC** (1-5%): "Afterburn" - elevated metabolism after workouts

### Why Two BMR Formulas?
- **Mifflin-St Jeor**: Best for most people (82% accuracy)
- **Katch-McArdle**: Best if you know your body fat % and are lean

The calculator automatically picks the better one for you!

### Why Protein Matters
Same calories, different results:

**Diet A** (100g protein):
- 2500 calories
- ~10% TEF = 250 calories burned

**Diet B** (200g protein):
- 2500 calories  
- ~12% TEF = 300 calories burned

**50 extra calories burned per day = 5 lbs fat loss per year!**

## 🏆 The Weight Trend Validation (GOLD STANDARD)

After 2+ weeks of consistent tracking:

**Example:**
- You ate 2500 cal/day for 14 days
- You lost 2.2 lbs

**Math:**
- Daily deficit = (2.2 lbs × 3500 cal/lb) ÷ 14 days = 550 cal/day
- **Your actual TDEE = 2500 + 550 = 3050 cal/day**

This bypasses ALL formulas and gives YOUR exact metabolic rate. As accurate as lab testing!
