## ⏰ Best Practices

### Daily (Morning):
- [ ] Weigh yourself (after bathroom, before eating/drinking)
- [ ] Open tracker on your device
- [ ] Select your user
- [ ] Save today's data (or yesterday's if you forgot)

### Weekly (Sunday):
- [ ] Review charts in Daily Tracker tab
- [ ] Check weight trend
- [ ] Compare calories to goals
- [ ] Update TDEE Calculator with new average weight
- [ ] Plan adjustments for next week

### Monthly:
- [ ] Recalculate TDEE if weight changed 10+ lbs
- [ ] Review energy trends
- [ ] Adjust calorie targets if needed

## 📈 Using the Charts

All charts support **pan/scroll** (zoom disabled for clean viewing):

1. **Weight Chart**: Track overall trend, ignore daily fluctuations
2. **Steps Chart**: Identify activity patterns
3. **Sleep Chart**: Correlate sleep with energy/performance

**Pro Tip**: Look for correlations! Low energy after poor sleep? Less steps on low-calorie days?

## 🔥 Power User Tips

**Weigh Daily** → Weekly averages smooth out water fluctuations  
**Track Everything** → Even "off" days matter for trends  
**Use Cloud Sync** → Data persists forever, accessible anywhere  
**Select Correct User** → Check user dropdown at top before entering data  
**Review Charts Weekly** → Patterns > individual days  
**Be Consistent** → Same time, same conditions (morning weigh-ins)  
**Trust the Process** → 2+ weeks of data = accurate TDEE

---

## 📊 After 2+ Weeks of Tracking

Use your tracked data in the TDEE Calculator tab:

1. Go to **Weight Trend Validation** section
2. Enter **start/end dates** (14+ days recommended)
3. Enter **start/end weights**
4. Enter **average daily calories**
5. Get **actual TDEE** (±2-5% accuracy!)

This is more accurate than any formula! 🏆

## 🚨 Red Flags to Watch

Monitor these patterns in your data:

- **Weight dropping >2 lbs/week** → Increase calories (muscle loss risk)
- **Energy consistently 1-2 ("Very Low" to "Low")** → Eat more or sleep more
- **Sleep <7 hrs regularly** → Fix this ASAP (affects BMR & recovery)
- **Steps decreasing over time** → Sign of adaptive thermogenesis
- **Workouts suffering** → Reduce volume or increase calories

---

## ☁️ Cloud Storage & Data

**Automatic Backup**: Data saves to Google Sheets automatically  
**Access Anywhere**: Use the deployed app link on any device  
**Never Lose Data**: Cloud storage persists across browser sessions  
**Multi-Device**: Start on phone, continue on computer  

**Local Fallback**: If Google Sheets fails, app uses JSON files locally

---

## 🎯 Goal-Specific Tracking

### Fat Loss (Moderate - Recommended):
- **Target**: TDEE - 500 cal = ~1 lb/week
- **Track**: Weight trending down, energy stable (3-4), lifts maintained
- **Red Flag**: Energy below 3 consistently, strength dropping

### Aggressive Fat Loss:
- **Target**: TDEE - 750 cal = ~1.5 lbs/week  
- **Track**: Higher diet fatigue, may need diet breaks
- **Red Flag**: Energy below 2, strength tanking, sleep suffering

### Lean Bulk:
- **Target**: TDEE + 200 cal = ~0.5 lb/week
- **Track**: Weight up slowly, lifts progressing, waist stable
- **Red Flag**: Gaining >1 lb/week, waist growing too fast

### Standard Bulk:
- **Target**: TDEE + 350 cal = ~0.75 lb/week
- **Track**: Faster gains, accept slightly more fat
- **Red Flag**: Gaining >1.5 lbs/week

### Maintenance:
- **Target**: Hit TDEE ±100 cal
- **Track**: Weight stable (±2 lbs range), performance maintained
- **Red Flag**: Unintended weight change over 2+ weeks
