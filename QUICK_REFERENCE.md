## 📈 After 2 Weeks

You can use weight trend data in TDEE Calculator tab:

2. Adjust targets based on real results
3. ±2-5% accuracy (better than any formula!)

### Lean Bulk:
- TDEE + 250 cal = ~0.5 lb/week
- Track: weight up slowly, lifts progressing, not getting fat

### Maintenance:
- Hit TDEE ±100 cal
- Track: weight stable, performance maintained
